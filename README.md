squaredetector
==============

SquareDetector is a Java implementation of an algorithm for detecting complete bipartite subgraph K(2,2) (squares) in undirected graphs using Hadoop MapReduce.

Before running the program, create 'squarecounter/input' directory and move data files to Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). Your output files will be available in the 'squarecounter/output' directory.

To run your program you have to compile the SquareDetector.java source file and create a squaredetector.jar file. Run the application in Hadoop using the 'jar' command.
